		<h4>General Information:</h4>
		<p><a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> aims to help researchers get their work done
			in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing skills.
			This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
			including program design, version control, data management, and task automation.
			Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
		</p>
		<p>
			For more information on what we teach and why, please see our paper 
			<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745">
				Best Practices for Scientific Computing</a>
		</p>
		
		<p><strong>Who:</strong>
			The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers.
			<strong>	
				You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.	
			</strong>
		</p>
		
		<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>
			Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system 
			(not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. 
			They should have a few specific software packages installed 
			(listed on the <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup/">Setup</a> page).
		</p>
		
		<p><strong>Code of Conduct:</strong>
			Everyone who participates in Carpentries activities is required to conform to the
			<a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>. 
			This document also outlines how to report an incident if needed.
		</p>
		
		<p><strong>Accessibility:</strong>
			We are committed to making this workshop accessible to everybody. The workshop organizers have checked that:
			<ul>
				<li>The room is wheelchair / scooter accessible.</li>
				<li>Accessible restrooms are available.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Materials will be provided in advance of the workshop and
			large-print handouts are available if needed by notifying the
			organizers in advance.  If we can help making learning easier for
			you (e.g. sign-language interpreters, lactation facilities) please
			get in touch (using contact details below) and we will attempt to provide them.
